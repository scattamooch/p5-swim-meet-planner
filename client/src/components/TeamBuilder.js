    return (
        <div>
            One-stop teambuilder. I'm picturing a table with 12 columns and 10 rows.
            A form at the top to name the team, then the table has a form in each
            cell. One form for the name, and then 1 form for each event. So each
            row is like adding a new swimmer. 
        </div>
    )
}

export default TeamBuilder;
